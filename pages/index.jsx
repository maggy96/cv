    description="I'm an experienced full-stack engineer, specialized in the
    React/NodeJS stack. I'm a big fan of agile practices and good teamwork.

    In my experience, one of the biggest challenges in growing teams is keeping things up to date and technical debt at bay.
    Also have a look at my GitHub profile to get a better idea of what I'm up to lately."
